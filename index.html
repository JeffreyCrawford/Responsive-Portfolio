      <p>
        Welcome to my personal homepage! My name is Jeff Crawford, and I'm currently employed as an IT contractor
        for NOPEC, a non-profit council of governments focused on reducing energy bills for local residents and 
        communities. I conduct data analysis on membership and savings, and administrate the technological and 
        reporting aspects of many of NOPEC's programs to facilitate their expansion throughout the state of Ohio.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have BAs in Political Science and Psychology from Case Western Reserve University with a concentration 
        on American political outreach and mobilization campaigns. I have additional history in IT helpdesk 
        support and several cycles of election experience. I am currently in a training program to be a full-stack
        web developer. I am seeking to leverage these skills to create custom web-based IT solutions
        for commercial and political use.
      </p>
